I think the main reason people and the band to an extent dislike it is because it was a transitional album. Kind of like Opeth, I view the band as having three distinct eras: Coclusion of An Age marks the end of the first, Edge Of the Earth marks the beginning of the second, with Dormant Heart being the end/middle child between that and their current era which began with Cycle of Suffering.

Josh is such a good lyricist that so many of the songs can be interpreted differently and for some reason those two resonate with me the most, but what are your interpretations of those songs? Especially since they seem to be the more “emotional” songs in the album', '*Absent* is about being unable to emotionally support someone due to your own depression. That’s from Josh himself I think.\\n\\nI think it’s also about accepting the realization that your own struggles are preventing you from fully connecting with someone you care about, and having to give yourself in pieces at a time as you’re able and hoping that will be good enough. \\n\\nI don’t know if Josh has spoken about *A Godless Throne* and its meaning, but my interpretation is that it’s about feeling as if your life has been wasted on you, and that someone else would have been more deserving of the time you were given. Feeling as if you’re never doing enough, not enjoying things you’re lucky to have, and grappling with the fact that you’re alive and healthy while someone (or multiple people) you’ve known and cared about have lost their lives.\\n\\nThe lines “I’m deaf to your words, I’m blind to your actions. I couldn’t sense the change in the air, or see the lights refractions” are interesting to me.\\n\\nThe first sentence might speak to the feeling of depression, and not being able to connect with someone or feel what they’re communication in a meaningful way. It might also speak to the regret when looking back at a cry for help that you didn’t initially notice, and maybe because you didn’t notice you weren’t able save someone who needed you.\\n\\nThe second sentence makes me think of the unimpressive nature of death. You hear stories about people intuitively knowing when someone close to them has died, like they could sense them passing on and feel the absence they left before they even knew they died. In my experience that hasn’t been the case though; you can watch someone in their final moments and intellectually know they’ve died, but there’s no significant sign or sensation. The air doesn’t change, there’s no visible spirit leaving the body, and you can’t even see light fading from their eyes. They’re there one moment, then they aren’t. Their loss might be emotionally catastrophic, but the whole process of death feels physically insignificant as your loved one unceremoniously becomes a piece of matter that looks exactly like them, but is no longer them. It’s not even as if it feels like their spirit has left their body, but rather that they just vanished into nonexistence while the world remains unchanged.\\n\\nThe line “And I’ll be waiting for the ground to swallow me, but only to close my eyes and not see it’s taken you” also makes me think of longing for someone who’s died, but feeling as if there will never be a reunion. You’ll die, and upon your death there will be no one to remember who you lost, and no reunion for you both. You’ll both have vanished, and if that’s the case, then why couldn’t they have at least gotten the time you were given that you couldn’t enjoy or didn’t feel worthy of? For you, maybe vanishing isn’t so bad, but the knowledge that they could have gotten more out of life than you can, yet they’re the one who lost their life, seems senseless and unfair. \\n\\nThose are Godless circumstances, and maybe A Godless Throne refers to the chaotic and sometimes cruel nature of the universe; if there’s a throne from which an omnipotent and loving ruler orchestrates the events of our world, it’s seemingly vacant.', 'Idk about absent, didn\\'t vibe with it,\\nBut godless throne is a recurring theme throughout the albums, from his talk in a podcast he said about edge of the earth (the song) that it was about the guilt he was feeling, and somehow he doesn\\'t know what is the source of it or what went wrong.                 \\n\\n\\nAnd in godless throne there\\'s this line, \"I don\\'t know where I belong, but I feel like I\\'ve done wrong\" it\\'s pretty self explanatory once you know it\\'s just guilt without a source']\n",

I loved playing the songs live from ASOTTC - PFTL, Pariahs, and Decent 👌 Very different than the older stuff but I loved playing Stained Humanity and the faster thrash ones, even though they’re a work out for the right arm. Luckily Josh started to put what I like to call “break riffs” in such as the chorus to I Sever, give your right arm a break for a bit before the mayhem continues 😅 A Serpents Tounge was the biggest struggle to play live, it’s so rapid.

Chris Adler was a fan and really cared about our well being on that tour, making sure we ate well and generally looked after us. He went out of his way for us and was one of the nicest dudes we met from big bands. \\n\\nThe best thing about being in the studio was witnessing Josh record. The man is a human midi machine. Some takes he did with Scott Atkins were so tight they were pretty much in phase. “Too tight, do it again” \\n\\nBack when I used to drink, during long tours when the exhaustion kicks in, it’s bound for mistakes to happen. Well one time I completely forgot a riff, muscle memory failed me, my natural reaction was to stop playing and started to kick my pedals, pretending it was a tech issue. Joined in again for the next riff. My top blag moment. \\n\\nDuring Graspop festival, Ali hit the sample pad by mistake, triggering a sample from an explicit adult cartoon.
